## Write Forward ✍🏼
Write Forward addresses the gap between personal reflection and the wisdom found in books by connecting your journal entries to insights from authors, philosophers, and psychologists. The problem it solves is helping people feel more understood and validated in their personal growth by showing them how their thoughts and struggles are part of a larger, timeless conversation.

By receiving a daily analysis of their journal entries, users can reflect on their experiences with fresh perspectives, leading to deeper self-awareness and those “Aha!” moments that promote personal growth. 

This project is live and you can use it at https://write-forward.vercel.app/
